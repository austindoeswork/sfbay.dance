With practice, students are able to carefully duel with one another, participate in official LudoSport tournaments, and over time, may even qualify to compete in National and World Championship events.\nLudoSport was founded in 2006 by 3 friends in Italy who had a vision for creating a combat sport that utilized the iconic light saber as a weapon. By combining their knowledge of various martial arts and sword arts, they developed a rich set of techniques that are now part of the ever evolving learning system for the sport. A number of schools have opened up in Europe since the inception of the sport and have amassed approximately 5000 LudoSport athletes around the world.\nThe first US academy launched in San Francisco in 2016 and has seen many students come through its doors since its opening. We are excited to have partnered with ODC to welcome you into a new world of learning, friendship, and fun whenever you're ready to visit and take a class!\nDiscovery classes are designed to give participants an overview of what LudoSport sporting light saber combat is all about. You'll be introduced to the fundamentals: the basic stances, movement, offensive and defensive techniques. At the end of the class you will have the opportunity to practice the techniques you learned in a sparring match. No experience necessary. For ages 16+\n\nPlease Wear/Bring:\nComfortable sportswear\nNon-marking/Non-black soled footwear\nA bottle of water\nWe'll Provide the Sabers! The Italian Designed Sport Saber LamaDiLuce Polaris SSe-1 will be available for your use during the class. Be ready for some fun!"

Designed for dancers who are new to floorwork but have some movement experience, this workshop emphasizes building tools and coordination to safely execute fundamental movements. Concepts and choreography are taught at a slower pace.\nWorking with and without momentum, dancers move through a variety of rolls, slides, inversions, and shoulder rolls focusing on efficiency for longevity, absorbing impact with muscular resistance, and developing qualitative movement textures.\nDancers can expect to gain:\n-a deeper physical expression of floorwork texture, dynamics, and flow\n-increased awareness of weight placement and its effect on spinal freedom and transitional clarity\n-tools for developing a lush, spongy movement quality\n-control and fluidity moving in and out of the floor\nDancers can expect to experience:\n-a relaxed environment where everyone can experience movement with joy and curiosity\n-ample personalized guidance\n-connection with other dancers in a non-judgmental learning space\n-a concentrated focus on movement concepts to improve efficiency and prevent injury\n-low-impact alternatives that build towards more challenging movements\n-guided written self-reflection\nPlease note: Enrollment for both days is required. No options for drop-in."

The style of dance arose from Harlem ballrooms in the early 1930s. This dance style was originally called \"performance\" and evolved into the more intricate and illusory form that is now called \"vogue-ing\".\nThere are six elements of Vogue-ing: hands, spins, catwalk, duck walk, dips and floor performance. The class will start with a fifteen-minute warm-up where we focus on core work and isolations. After the warm-up, we will transition into across the floor work. Not only will you learn the history of Vogue, but you will receive an intense workout.\nJocquese will break down each element from hands to spins, catwalk to duck walk, dips to floor performance. Each element has specific movements that will strengthen and engage different parts of the body."
